# AirPod Case



## Problem Statement
#### - You cannot check the battery percent of your AirPods without the use of a phone. The people who identify this as a problem are non-iPhone users and students. The environment in which this occurs is at school or a busy setting. This problem has been occurring since Apple released AirPods. According to the poll I created, 88% of the 30 students I polled agree that this is a problem they have.
