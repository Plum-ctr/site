#### By Wyatt Plumley 
#### Oct 28 

## Executive summary:
#### The purpose of my project is to allow someone to be able to tell the battery penchant of their Airpod case without the use of their phone. The way I plan on doing this is by having a screen on the front of the case telling you the battery penchant of the Airpod case.  


## Terms
#### "AirPods" Refers to the earbuds.
#### "Shell" Refers to the container that hold the AirPods.
#### "Case" Refers to the thing that protects the Shell and inturn also the AirPods.

## Problem Statement
#### -You cannot check the battery percent of your AirPods without the use of a phone. The people who identify this as a problem are non-iPhone users and students. The environment in which this occurs is at school or a busy setting. This problem has been occurring since Apple released AirPods. According to the poll I created, 88% of the 30 students I polled agree that this is a problem they have.
